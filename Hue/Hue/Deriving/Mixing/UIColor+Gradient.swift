     Generates an array of colors between a start color and an end color. The colors are
     produced by mixing the start color with the end color with evenly distanced stops.

     - parameter start: The starting color of the gradient.
     - parameter end: The ending color of the gradient.
     - parameter stops: The number of colors to be produced, including the start and end.
                        For example, 5 stops would return the following:
                        `[start, 25%, 50%, 75%, end]`

     - returns: The array of colors forming the gradient.
