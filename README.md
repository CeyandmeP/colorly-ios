# Colorly
> An iOS utility framework for working with colors.

## Usage

#### Mixing
``` swift
// Returns a mixture of two colors with a given weight.
UIColor.mixing(.red, with: .blue)
//UIColor.mixing(.red, with: .blue, weight: 0.5)
UIColor.red.mixed(with: .blue)
//UIColor.red.mixed(with: .blue, weight: 0.5)

// Arithmetic
let rose = (UIColor.magenta * 0.5) + (UIColor.red * 0.5)
let chartreuse = (UIColor.yellow * 0.5) + (UIColor.green * 0.5)
```

#### Shades, Tints, Tones
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
color.shade() // Returns a mixture of the color with black, decreasing lightness.
//color.shade(percent: 0.1)
color.tint() // Returns a mixture of the color with white, increasing lightness.
//color.tint(percent: 0.1)
color.tone() // Returns a mixture of the color with gray, decreasing saturation.
//color.tone(percent: 0.1)
```

#### Saturated / Desaturated / Grayscaled
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
color.saturated() // Returns a new instance of the color with increased saturation.
//color.saturated(percent: 0.1)
color.desaturated() // Returns a new instance of the color with decreased saturation.
//color.desaturated(percent: 0.1)
color.grayscaled() // Returns a new instance of the color with 0% saturation.
```

#### Lighter / Darker
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
color.lighter() // Returns a new instance of the color with increased lightness.
//color.lighter(percent: 0.1)
color.darker() // Returns a new instance of the color with decreased lightness.
//color.darker(percent: 0.1)
```

#### Hue Adjustment
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
color.adjustingHue(by: 180.0) // Returns a new instance of the color with an adjusted hue.
color.complement // The color opposite on the color wheel, equivalant to adjusting the hue by 180Â°.
color.isCool // Returns true if the color falls on the cool side of the color wheel.
color.isWarm // Returns true if the color falls on the warm side of the color wheel.
```

#### Inverted
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
color.inverted // The negative of the color, produced by inverting the RGB values.
```

#### Harmonies
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
let harmonies = color.harmonies
harmonies.monochromatic // Different tints and shades of the same color.
harmonies.complementary // Two opposite colors on the color wheel.
harmonies.splitComplementary // A color and the two adjacent tertiary colors of its complement.
harmonies.analogous // Three adjacent colors on the color wheel.
harmonies.triadic // Three evenly spaced colors on the color wheel.
harmonies.tetradic // Two complementary pairs in a rectangular pattern on the color wheel.
harmonies.square // Two evenly spaced complementary pairs on the color wheel.
```

#### Gradients
``` swift
// Generates an array of colors between a start and end color.
UIColor.gradient(between: .orange, and: .purple)
UIColor.gradient(between: .orange, and: .purple, stops: 5)
UIColor.gradient(between: .orange, and: .purple, customStops: [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0])
```

#### Randomization
``` swift
UIColor.random() // Returns a color with random component values.
UIColor.randomSet(of: 5) // Returns a set of unique colors with random component values.
```

#### Contrast Ratio
``` swift
// Returns the contrast ratio between two colors based on their luminance values.
UIColor.contrastRatio(between: .black, and: .white)
UIColor.black.contrastRatio(to: .white)

// Compares the contrast ratio of the color to two others and returns which of the two has the higher ratio.
UIColor.red.higherContrastingColor(between: .black, and: .white)
// Compares the contrast ratio of the color to an array of others and returns the one with the highest ratio.
UIColor.white.highestContrastingColor(between: [.red, .green, .blue])

// Compares the contrast ratio of the color to two others and returns which of the two has the lower ratio.
UIColor.red.lowerContrastingColor(between: .black, and: .white)
// Compares the contrast ratio of the color to an array of others and returns the one with the lowest ratio.
UIColor.white.lowestContrastingColor(between: [.red, .green, .blue])
```

#### Accessibility Compliance
``` swift
// The visual presentation of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (Level AA)
UIColor.isCompliant(with: .minimum, testing: .black, against: .white)
// The visual presentation of large text has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 (Level AA)
UIColor.isCompliant(with: .minimumLargeText, testing: .black, against: .white)
// The visual presentation of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 (Level AAA)
UIColor.isCompliant(with: .enhanced, testing: .black, against: .white)
// The visual presentation of large text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (Level AAA)
UIColor.isCompliant(with: .enhancedLargeText, testing: .black, against: .white)
```

#### Luminance Values
``` swift
let color = UIColor.red
color.relativeLuminance // The relative luminance of the color, measured according to the HSL color model.
color.perceivedBrightness // The perceived brightness of the color, measured according to the HSP color model.
color.isLight // Returns true if the color is considered light according to its perceived brightness.
color.isDark // Returns true if the color is considered dark according to its perceived brightness.
